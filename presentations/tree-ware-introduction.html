    <h1>Tree-Ware Introduction</h1>
    <p>Accelerate your software development!</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>The Problem</h1>
    <section>Companies struggle with feature velocity</section>
    <section>They use a lot of open-source software to speed up their development</section>
    <section>But that alone is <b>NOT</b> sufficient!</section>
    <section>Every new functional feature requires glue-logic across all this open-source software</section>
    <section>Every new non-functional feature requires modifications to all existing functional features</section>
    <section>It is very hard to ensure all features are implemented consistently</section>
    <section>
        <p>The initial rush-to-market results in bad practices</p>
        <p>And that results in slower subsequent releases</p>
    </section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>The Solution</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>tree-ware</h2>
        An end-to-end declarative open-source framework
    </section>
    <section>
        <p><b>End-to-end</b></p>
        <p>UIs, APIs, load-balancers, caches, databases, compute-pipelines, devices</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p><b>Declarative</b></p>
        <p><b>System-wide</b> schema specified by developers</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p><b>Open-source</b></p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/tree-ware">https://github.com/tree-ware</a></p>
    </section>
    <section>New functional features do NOT require glue-logic across the software stack</section>
    <section>New non-functional features can be added WITHOUT modifying existing functional features</section>
    <section>
        <p>The bulk of the feature implementation is in tree-ware</p>
        <p>This ensures all features are implemented consistently</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Tree-ware lets you rush-to-market without bad practices</p>
        <p>Tree-ware further enables faster subsequent releases</p>
    </section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Work Involved?</h1>
    <section>
        <p>Developers only define the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>a schema for the product/service data</li>
            <li>custom business-logic (if any)</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>Tree-ware takes care of everything else</section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
    <section>Tree-ware uses a <b>data-first</b> approach</section>
    <section>Developers define the data corresponding to the functional features</section>
    <section>And tree-ware provides the non-functional features</section>
    <section>
        <p>It sets up & operates infrastructure</p>
        <p><b><i>for</i></b></p>
        <p>the data defined in the schema</p>
    </section>
    <section>It provides the glue-logic for the necessary infrastructure</section>
    <section>
        <p>It uses existing infrastructure:</p>
        <p>Databases, queues, compute-pipelines, etc.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>And provides other custom infrastructure:</p>
        <p>UI, load-balancer, API server, cache, RBAC, feature-flags, etc.</p>
    </section>

<section>
    <h1>Is this No-Code?</h1>
    <section>Yes and No</section>
    <section>
        <h2>No</h2>
        Targeted at developers, not non-developers
    </section>
    <section>Designed for building production systems</section>
    <section>
        <h2>Yes</h2>
        Requires no code or a low amount of code
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Non-developers can build features</p>
        <p><b><i>after</i></b></p>
        <p>developers build products with tree-ware</p>
    </section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Common Concerns</h1>
    <section>Tree-ware has solved common concerns people have with such frameworks</section>
    <section>What if I want to do something the framework does not support?</section>
    <section>
        <p>Tree-ware does not limit what can be done</p>
        <p>It is modular and custom code can be inserted wherever needed</p>
    </section>
    <section>How do I prevent the framework from overwriting my manually written code?</section>
    <section>Tree-ware generated code and manually written code do not exist in the same files</section>
    <section>Can it scale?</section>
    <section>Tree-ware was built from the ground up for scale</section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>What's the Catch?</h1>
    <section>
        <p>It is less than ideal for existing systems</p>
        <p>But it is perfect for brand new systems</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>It is not fully implemented</p>
        <p>But there is enough for a first release</p>
        <p>And it is a great foundation to build on</p>
    </section>

<section>
    <h1>Recap</h1>
    <section>Tree-ware accelerates feature development by taking care of all non-functional aspects</section>
    <section>Developers only specify the schema of functional data, and any custom business-logic</section>
    <section>New non-functional features can be added WITHOUT modifying existing functional features</section>
</section>
