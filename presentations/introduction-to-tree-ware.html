    <h1>The Problem</h1>
    <section>Companies struggle with feature velocity</section>
    <section>They use a lot of open-source software to speed up their development</section>
    <section>But that alone is <b>NOT</b> sufficient!</section>
    <section>Every new functional feature requires glue-logic across all this open-source software</section>
    <section>Every new non-functional features requires modifications to all existing functional features</section>
    <section>Very hard to ensure all features are implemented consistently</section>
    <section>Bad practices in the initial rush-to-market result in slower subsequent releases</section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>The Solution</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>tree-ware</h2>
        An end-to-end data-driven open-source framework to accelerate software development!
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>End-to-end</h2>
        UIs, APIs, load-balancers, caches, databases, compute-pipelines, devices
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Data-driven</h2>
        <b>System-wide</b> schema specified by developers
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Open-source</h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/tree-ware">https://github.com/tree-ware</a>
    </section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>How?</h1>
    <section>Uses a <b>system-wide</b> schema to set up & operate infrastructure</section>
    <section>Takes care of non-functional features</section>
    <section>Developers only need to define a <b>system-wide</b> schema & custom business-logic</section>
    <section>
        <p>Targets existing infrastructure</p>
        <p>Databases, queues, compute-pipelines, etc.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>Provides other infrastructure</p>
        <p>UI, load-balancer, API server, cache, RBAC, feature-flags, etc.</p>
    </section>
