    <h1>Tree-Ware Architecture</h1>
    <p>Accelerate your software development!</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Data-First</h1>
    <section>The data corresponding to FUNCTIONAL features must be defined first</section>
    <section>Tree-ware provides the architectural features for this data</section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Model</h1>
    <section>The runtime data is called <b>Model</b></section>
    <section>It is (primarily) a tree structure</section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Meta-Model</h1>
    <section>The definition for the Model is called <b>Meta-Model</b></section>
    <section>Many data types are supported</section>
    <section>Packages, Entities, Fields, Enumerations, Primitives, Aliases</section>
    <section>Compositions (nested entities) make it a tree</section>
    <section>Associations (references to other entities) make it a directed-graph</section>
    <section>Various constraints can be declared in the meta-model</section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Aux Data</h1>
    <section>Auxiliary data can be attached to any node in the model tree</section>
    <section>Used for architectural aspects</section>
    <section>Examples: errors, access-control definitions, DB mappings</section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Model Operator</h1>
    <section>Operates on one or more models</section>
    <section>Codec: encode/decode JSON, Protobuf, SQL, etc</section>
    <section>Intersection: determine what is common between 2 or more models</section>
    <section>Union: determine the combination of 2 or more models</section>
    <section>Difference: determine the difference between 2 models</section>
    <section>Operators can be composed to create versatile expressions</section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>System Architecture</h1>
    <section>There is a pipeline from the UI to the DB and beyond</section>
    <section>Models flow through this pipeline in both directions</section>
    <section>Most pipeline stages implement an architectural feature</section>
    <section>Custom business-logic is also a stage in the pipeline</section>
    <section>Each architectural stage is implemented as an operator</section>
    <section>The pipeline is in essence an expression composed of operators</section>
    <section><img src="./pipeline.drawio.svg"></section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Architecture Benefits</h1>
    <section>The pipeline can be run on a single machine or distributed across multiple machines</section>
    <section>
        <p>The pipeline can support new functional features</p>
        <p>without glue logic</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p>New architectural features can be inserted</p>
        <p>as pipeline stages</p>
        <p>without modifying existing functional features</p>
    </section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Tree-Ware Design Pattern</h1>
    <section>Use models for functional-data</section>
    <section>Use aux data for architectural data</section>
    <section>Use model operators to implement architectural features</section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>API</h1>
    <section>Get-requests are model trees specifying the parts of the model to be returned</section>
    <section>Get-responses are model trees corresponding to the parts requested</section>
    <section>Set-requests are model trees containing the nodes to be created/updated/deleted</section>
    <section>Set-request models are validated against the meta-model</section>
    <section>Fan-out: a request can be split into smaller trees and load-balanced to different servers</section>
    <section>Fan-in: responses from the fan-out can be combined into a single response</section>
    <section>Stream: responses from the fan-out can be streamed back to the client as they arrive</section>
    <section>Both set-requests and get-requests are via HTTPS POST and JSON</section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>RBAC</h1>
    <section>
        <p>An RBAC role is a model that only contains nodes that are accessible</p>
        <p>Aux data on these nodes specify the required permissions</p>
    </section>
    <section>An intersection operator intersects API requests/responses with the RBAC model</section>
    <section>Only the common parts (the intersection result) are permitted to the next stage in the pipeline</section>
    <section><img src="./rbac.drawio.svg"></section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Feature-Flags</h1>
    <section>Extremely fine-grained feature-flags at the individual field level</section>
    <section>Aux data indicates readiness: in-progress, developed, tested, released, etc.</section>
    <section>A filter operator can filter a model based on readiness</section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>DB</h1>
    <section>The model is mapped automatically to appropriate databases</section>
    <section>
        <p>Configuration is mapped to an SQL database</p>
        <p>State/metrics is mapped to a metrics database</p>
    </section>
    <section>Schema for the databases is taken care of by tree-ware</section>
    <section>Code for writing to and reading from the databases is taken care of by tree-ware</section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>API & DB Migration</h1>
    <section>Meta-model evolution is validated to ensure changes are backward-compatible</section>
    <section>The difference operator is used on the new version and the previously released version</section>
    <section>API and DB migrations are generated based on the differences computed by the operator</section>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>Code Generation</h1>
    <section>Most of tree-ware is data-driven, but a few things are generated</section>
    <section>OpenAPI (Swagger) specification</section>
    <section>UML diagram of the model</section>
    <section>Typesafe model classes for use in business-logic</section>
    <section>Liquibase DB schemas and DB migration scripts</section>
</section>

    <p>Java</p>

    <h1>Given a model tree of ONLY the config</h1>
    <section>How do we generate a UI for it?</section>
    <section>Hint 1: a UI is a tree</section>
    <section>Hint 2: JSON is a tree</section>
    <section>How do we customize the components shown for certain fields?</section>
